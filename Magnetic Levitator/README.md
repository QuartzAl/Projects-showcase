# Magnetic Levitator

A simple magnetic levitator I made with an ON-OFF controller, the system kind of Proportional controller's itself because of the inductive effect of the coil, hence why not need to use an actual proportional controller. The coil had to be wound with care as inalignment of the coil would reduce it's magnetic strength, the object to be lifted in this levitator has to also be a magnet in order to give proper feedback to the SS49E sensor. The frame of the magnetic levitator I built from several pieces of cut cardboard and hotglue, enough to hold the coil and circuit.


## Components

The main components used for the magnetic levitator is as follows:
- 2 ounces of 0.5mm diameter copper wire (around 120 Meters)
- SS49E linear hall effect sensor
- an MP1584 step down converter
- LM358 OpAmp
- IRLZ44n
- 1N5819; and
- some resistors and capacitors
