# Analog Light-Tracking Robot with Collision Detection

This project details the development of an analog light-tracking robot, featuring control circuitry based on 555 timers and an H-bridge motor driver. It also incorporates a collision detection system for autonomous navigation.

## Features

* **Analog Control:** Utilizes 555 timers for light-tracking control logic.
* **H-Bridge Motor Driver:** Implements an H-bridge to control the robot's motors.
* **Light-Tracking:** Follows a light source using two light-dependent resistors (LDRs).
* **Collision Detection:** Integrated collision detection system for obstacle avoidance.
* **Autonomous Navigation:** Robot autonomously reverses and navigates away from obstacles.
* **Custom PCB:** Design based on the bill of materials below.
